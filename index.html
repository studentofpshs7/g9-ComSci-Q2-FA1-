          <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
          <p id="mop1">I wake up at 5 am to get to the field early for work. I get out of bed, then I take a quick shower, to save time.
            After my shower, I change to some clothes that cover me well, so I don't get sunburnt later in the day. I make a sandwich for
          breakfast then I leave the house at 7am. </p>
          <p id="mop2">Today I have to catch some insect specimens, so I am now on my way to a forest in the area. While waiting during ride there and eating my sandwich,
            I check what insects I need to get.<p>
        </section>

        <section id="midday">
          <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
          <p>I make it to the forest, and eventually find a good spot with a couple bugs I need. I set down my tools & equipment, and take out my net. First I need some flying insects, so I attempt to catch some of them
            with my net, the ones I caught being put in a killing jar. These jars work like a mini gas chamber to kill insects more conveniently. It's especially helpful since insects are rather difficult to kill without accidently
            squashing them.</p>
          <p>After a few hours of that, I eat my lunch. Afterwards, the work continues; the rest of my tasks are noting the bugs that can be found in the area, and making sure some invasive bug species are being kept in check.
            Later I will compile my notes and other information in a document when I get back home.

          <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
          <p>Insects are very useful and can even help in a crime scene, for "they never lie". They can leave lots pf traces, and can help you just by doing what they do.</p>
          <p>An example applying this include, insects like coffin flies. They dig about 2 meters in the ground to breed in near or in human corpses. Using these bugs, you can find out how long a corpse has been buried for, -which can help to verify and piece evidence together in solving a case. </p>
